## Prerequisites

In order to run this API, you'll need a few things set up. Arguably the most important requirement is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system. After that, it's just a matter of integrating it into your local [Kit](https://github.com/The-Kitsune-Group/Kit) install by pulling the image and running it. This happens automatically, should you use the default Compose config. Besides that, you'll need change some environment variables in the .env file in order to configure the API, listed here:
- ``DBUSER``: the database user
- ``DBPASS``: the database password
